    | Detail: | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | This will be the user-facing display name for the application. (This name can be changed and it will be the name of the application that the user sees when they authenticate with the captive portal.) |
    | Supported Account Types | **Choose the option that best suites your use case.** <br> <br> For internal access only, we suggest using the `Private only - Single Tenant` option. <br> For other use cases like public facing, you can use the `Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant and personal accounts option`. |
    | Redirect URI | For this option, we reccommend using the `Web` as the platform type and `https://captive.mkcld.io/callback` as the callback URL. |
