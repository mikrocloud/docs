You have now successfully removed your Captive Portal Instance from your MikroCloud portal. Give the system a few moments to finalize the changes.

:::Note
Any sites that were connected to this captive portal instance will need a few minutes to apply the changes.
:::

:::warning
Removing the captive portal will affect connectivity to the subnets specified and the hosts associated with the captive portal.

This deletion of the captive portal will result in anyone being able to connect to the subnets.

If this instance was public facing and set up for a Wi-Fi network without any authentication methods, it is highly advised to change the authentication methods and enforce password authentication.

Should it have been set up for LAN networks, anyone will now be able to access the subnets by plugging in to the network.
