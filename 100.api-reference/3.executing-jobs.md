This document explains how to run jobs on a MikroTik router using both synchronous and asynchronous methods.

## Synchronous Execution

The synchronous API is a wrapper around the MikroTik RouterOS native API. It allows you to make real-time API calls to
the MikroTik via the [management tunnel](/documentation/deployments/management-vpn). This method is recommended for
real-time read operations and not for configuration changes due to potential issues with delivery guarantees and
idempotency.

### The Synchronous API Object

| Property     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`    | string | The MikroTik API command to execute.                                                                                              |
| `parameters` | string | Optional. Contains API parameters as defined in the [MikroTik API documentation](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/API). |

### Endpoint

`POST` `/api/synchronous/{router_id}`

### Payload Example: Listing ARP

```json
{
  "command": "/ip/arp/print"
}
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "*1",
      "address": "192.168.88.254",
      "mac_address": "50:32:37:7B:93:49",
      "interface": "bridge",
      "published": "false",
      "invalid": "false",
      "DHCP": "false",
      "dynamic": "true",
      "complete": "true",
      "disabled": "false"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Making Configuration Changes

While it is possible to make changes using the synchronous API, it is recommended to use the asynchronous API for such
operations. If you choose to use the synchronous API, use the `/execute` command with `=script=` in the parameters for
easier command syntax.

#### Example: Adding an IP Address

```json
{
  "command": "/execute",
  "parameters": "=script=/ip address add address=10.0.0.1/30 interface=ether1 disabled=no"
}
```

### Important Note

The synchronous API does not guarantee delivery and does not implement idempotent requests. This means you might add the
same configuration twice if using queuing systems on your side. Use this API mainly for real-time read operations.

---

## Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous API allows you to trigger actions on a MikroTik router without waiting for an immediate response. This
method is more reliable for configuration changes and tasks that do not need to be executed in real-time.

### How the Asynchronous System Works

1. **Job Submission**: You submit a job to the API with a specific script and other optional parameters.
2. **Job Processing**: The job is queued and processed asynchronously. If `express_execute` is set to `true`, the job is
   executed immediately.
3. **Notifications**: You can provide a `notify_url` where the status of the job will be posted (e.g., loaded, running,
   completed, failed, or deleted).
4. **Acknowledgment**: If `needs_acknowledgement` is `true`, the system waits for acknowledgment before marking the job
   as completed.

| `description`           | string  | Required. A brief description of the action. Visible in the portal when the user views the orchestration log. Max 100 characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `script`                | string  | The script to be executed asynchronously. Should be RouterOS commands separated by semicolons. Required, max 2000 characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `make_backup`           | boolean | Indicates whether a backup should be created before executing the script. Required, default is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `express_execute`       | boolean | Specifies whether the script should be executed without delay. When `true`, an attempt will be made to invoke the scheduler immediately. Default is `false`. Required.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `needs_acknowledgement` | boolean | Specifies whether the action requires acknowledgment. When `false`, the job will be marked as completed immediately, and no errors will be caught and reported. This is useful for tasks like rebooting a router when the script will be interrupted on the router before it notifies MikroCloud of the outcome. Required, default is `true`. |
| `notify_url`            | string  | The URL to which notifications should be sent. Should start with `https`. MikroCloud will post job updates here when the job is loaded, running, completed, failed, or deleted.
