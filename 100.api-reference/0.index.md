Welcome to the MikroCloud API documentation. This documentation provides detailed information on how to authenticate,
execute jobs, and use various endpoints.

# Base URL

All API requests must be made to the following base URL:

```http
https://mkcld.io/
```

Ensure to include this base URL in your requests to access the API endpoints correctly.

# Avoid Integrating Frontend Endpoints

MikroCloud has upwards of 200 API endpoints that support the frontend application. However, it is not recommended to
integrate these endpoints into your applications as they often undergo rapid development cycles, meaning they may change
frequently.

Any endpoint documented here that starts with `/api/` can be considered stable and will not change. These stable
endpoints will be versioned if changes occur.

For detailed information on each endpoint, please refer to the specific sections in this documentation.
