## Introduction

The `/api/routers` endpoint retrieves a list of MikroTik routers that belong to the team associated with
the [bearer token](/documentation/api-reference/authentication). Each router object provides detailed information about
the router, including its identity, software version, uptime, and last seen details.

## The Router Object

| Property           | Type    | Description                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | string  | The id field is an autogenerated v4 UUID that uniquely identifies the router.                                 |
| `identity`         | string  | The identity field is the RouterOS identity or hostname of the router.                                        |
| `serial_number`    | string  | The serial_number field contains the serial number of the router. For CHR instances, this is the software ID. |
| `software_version` | string  | The software_version field indicates the current RouterOS version running on the router.                      |
| `software_id`      | string  | The software_id field is an identifier for the specific software running on the router.                       |
| `has_pulse`        | boolean | The has_pulse field indicates if the site is online or offline based on the check-in scheduler.               |
| `uptime`           | string  | The uptime field provides the duration for which the router has been running without interruption.            |
| `last_seen`        | string  | The last_seen field indicates the time elapsed since the router was last seen.                                |
| `last_seen_from`   | string  | The last_seen_from field is the IP address observed during the most recent heartbeat from the router.         |
| `routerboard`      | boolean | The routerboard field indicates if the device is a RouterBOARD model. (false for CHRs)                        |
| `model`            | string  | The model field specifies the model of the router.                                                            |
| `board_name`       | string  | The board_name field provides the board name of the router.                                                   |
| `last_seen_at`     | string  | The last_seen_at field is a timestamp of the last time the router was seen.                                   |
| `created_at`       | string  | The created_at field is a timestamp of when the router was created.                                           |

## Retrieve OEM Information

The `/api/routers/{router_id}/oem` endpoint allows you to obtain manufacturer data for a given router. This information
is maintained by MikroCloud and periodically retrieved from MikroTik. Efforts are made to ensure the data is accurate
and extensive, but it is possible that data for particular hardware may not exist.

### Endpoint

`GET` `/api/routers/{router_id}/oem`

### Sample Response

```json

These fields are generated based on the router's specifications, so it is possible that some columns may be null. This
API also includes data on port speeds, and test speeds, and can be useful for rightsizing.
