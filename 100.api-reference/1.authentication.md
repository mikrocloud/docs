title: 'Authentication'

Our API uses a Bearer token for authentication. This token must be included in all requests as a header. The token
format is `uuid:uuid:token`, where the token is a 62-character alphanumeric string.

## Header Example

```http
Authorization: Bearer 0000-0000-0000-0000-0000:0000-0000-0000-0000-0000:abc...
```

## Rate Limits

- **60 requests per minute per API key.**

## Authorization

- The API key belongs to a team.
- It is authorized only to access resources that belong to the team.

## Request Format

- All requests must be in JSON format.

## Example Request

```http
GET /api/resource
Authorization: Bearer 0000-0000-0000-0000-0000:0000-0000-0000-0000-0000:abc...
Content-Type: application/json
```

Ensure your API key and Bearer token are kept secure to maintain the integrity and security of your requests and
resources.
