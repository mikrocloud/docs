### What is OAuth 2.0?
OAuth 2.0 is an open standard protocol for authorization that allows third-party applications to access user data or resources without exposing the user's credentials (such as usernames and passwords). It's widely used by services like Google, Facebook (Meta), Microsoft, and GitHub for providing secure access to external applications.

:::Note
To enable authentication via third-party identity providers such as GitHub, Google, and Azure, you must set up OAuth 2.0 connectors for these providers. Ensure that your OAuth configurations are properly established and authorized within each identity provider's platform before activating your Captive Portal instance.

Failure to do so may prevent users from successfully authenticating.
:::

#### Now, let's get you set up, we will discuss setting up both OAuth connectors and the Captive Portal Instances in the documents below.
