Tags serve as a system for categorizing devices. By creating and assigning these tags, you can effectively organize and filter devices based on custom categories that are meaningful for your environment and use case.

#### Key Features
| Feature: | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tag Creation | Users can create tags by selecting a color and assigning a label to the tag. The color provides a visual cue, while the label represents the category or function of the tag.
| Tag Assignment: | Once a tag is created, it can be applied to any device. Multiple tags can be assigned to a single device/ site, allowing you to customize your system. |
| Device Filtering: | While on the `Sites` page, you can use tags to filter the list of devices. This helps you to quickly and efficiently locate devices associated with the specific tags. |

## Use Cases

| Group Devices by Function or Role | Tags can be used to organize devices based on their function or operation role. |**"Wi-Fi AP", "Core Router", "HomeLab", "Testing", "Prod", "Backup"** |
| Tracking Maintenance and Status | Tags can be used to track the status of devices, such as whether they are active, undergoing maintenance, or in a critical state. | **"Under Maintenance", "Critical", "Inactive", "Needs Review"** |
|Prioritization | In situations where devices require higher priority or needs special monitoring.| **"High Priority", "Critical Service", "VIP", "Emergency"**|
| Grouping Devices by Project or Client | For Teams managing multiple projects or clients, these tags can be used to group devices based on the associated project or customer. | **"Client A", "Project X", "Customer Support", "R&D"** |
| Identifying Devices for Scheduled Tasks | Tags can help you schedule tasks like updates, audits or inspections by marking the relevant devices in advance.| **"Scheduled Update", "Audit Pending", "Inspection Q2**|
