This documentation section will introduce you to our VPN solution designed for seamless integration with your existing MikroTik devices. This overview will guide you through the essential aspects of the VPN service, including pricing, setup and key security considerations, providing the groundwork you need before implementation.

## How it Works
The VPN instances share the same **seat-based** licensing model as your existing MikroCloud enabled MikroTik devices.

#### Here's a breakdown of how it works:
**Seat Usage:** To create a VPN server, you must have at least `10 free seats` available. Each user or site that you add to the VPN instance occupies one seat.
* `1 user = 1 seat`
* `1 site = 1 seat`

:::Note
Let's say that you have **25 licenses** in your account, and you already have **10 sites** configured, that means that you have **15 seats** available. When you set up a VPN instance, it reserves **10 seats**.
* The first 10 sites or users you add to this VPN instance will utilize these reserved seats.
* after filling these, any further sites or users will use the remaining seats.

For instance, let's say you now add another **10 sites** and **5 users** to the VPN instance, you will have used up all 25 seats. 
* To add more sites or users beyond this, you will need to upgrade your subscription to allocate additional seats.
:::

## VPN Limits and Expansion:
Currently, you are limited in the following ways for the VPN service.

* **Instances:** Each account is limited to `10 VPN instances`
    * This can be increased upon request.
* **Sites Per VPN Instance:** Up to `250 sites` can be added to a single VPN instance.
* **Users Per VPN Instance:** Up to `250 Users` can be added to a single VPN instance.

The service provides flexibility and scalability, allowing you to tailor your VPN setup to meet your needs while ensuring you stay within your licensing capacity.
