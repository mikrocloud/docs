    * Give the system a few moments to orchestrate the change and add the user to the Instance.

Your own user profile will not be added to the VPN Instance automatically, this helps to ensure that you are creating either a site-to-site or a site-to-user VPN, or both if you'd like.

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Download (Left) | This will allow you to download the configuration to your local machine, which you can then use to manually share the configuration, or import it into your own wireguard application. |
| Share (Middle)  | This button will allow you to share your configuration with others by creating a **shareable link**.                                                                                   |
| Copy (Right)    | This button will allow you to copy the configuration.                                                                                                                                  |

4. Congratulations, you have now successfully removed the user from your VPN Instance, and they will no longer have access to your resources via the WireGuard application.

:::warning

There are some key points to note that are **extremely important.**
* The VPN will only become inactive once the user disconnects from the VPN, only thereafter will they no longer have access.

:::

5. Once the user has been removed, a small confirmation dialog will pop up, verifying that the user has been removed, and it will look like the picture below.
