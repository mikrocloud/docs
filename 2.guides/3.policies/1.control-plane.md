## Default Policy
When you sign up for MikroCloud, a default CPF policy is automtically created. This default policy includes pre-configured settings that ensure basic protection and mangement access.

| Input Rule:             | Description:                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trusted Networks:**   | Common private networks (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0./16` and `172.16.0.0/12`) are pre-set as trusted.                                |
| **IP Services:**        | Essential management services like `Winbox`, `API`, and `SSH` are pre-enabled with default ports.                                          |
| **Custom input Rules:** | Enabled by default, which means that your own rules will be prioritized before our drop rules will be added below your custom input rules. |

This default policy provides an immediate layer of protection and manacement access, which can be furter customized as needed.

:::Note
An IP address of `154.66.115.255/32` is added by default, this is MikroCloud's managemengt IP address and any API calls and configurations will be sent from this IP Address, thus why it is trusted by default.
