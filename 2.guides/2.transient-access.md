This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up shortcuts to help you connect to your sites quicker, it also outlines the various methods of accessing your devices.

## Introduction
**Transient Access** is a features designed to provide temporary, secure access to MikroTik devices through a managed tunnel. When you use this feature, the MikroCloud platform generates temporary credentials that allow you to connect to yoru router using WinBox or SSH.

#### This process works in the following way:
| # | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Secure Tunnel: | When a router is added to the MikroCloud Portal, a secure tunnel is automatically created. |
| 2. | Generate Credentails: | Temporary login credentials are generated via the MikroCloud portal. |
| 3. | Access and Use: | Once the credentials are generated, they can be used to connect to the device. The WinBox launcher and SSH terminal simplifies this process by handling the connection automtically. |
| 4. | Automatic Revocation: | The generated credentials expire after a set amount of time, but you can also manually revoke them. |

This feature ensures secure and conventient remote management of your devices without the need for complex configurations and permanent exposure.

:::Note
For documentation about connecting to a device remotely, see our [remote winbox login](/documentation/guides/remote-winbox-login) page for instructions.

## WinBox
In an effort to streamline the connection to your MikroTik router, we provide a WinBox launcher for both **Microsoft Windows** and **macOS**. These launchers simplify the connection process and eliminates the need for manual credential entry.

### Windows Launcher
This is a quick walkthrough that will take you through the steps for installing the MikroCloud WinBox laucher on your machine.

#### Step 1: Download WinBox
Download the latest version of **WinBox** from the MikroTik Website.

:::Note
You can also click on [this](https://mt.lv/winbox64) link that will download it directly from the MikroTik website.
:::

#### Step 2: Download the Launcher
Download the Launcher from [this](https://cdn.mikrocloud.com/downloads/winbox-open.exe) link.


#### Step 3: Move the files to your C: Drive
Move the 2 files that you downloaded to the `C:\` drive.
* These files must be accessible at `C:\winbox64.exe` and `C:\winbox-open.exe`.

#### Step 4: Add protocol handler to registry
Download the custom protocol handler we wrote for Windows.
Once downloaded, run the `winbox-handler.reg` file.
* It contains registry instructions and is safe to execut.
* You can download it [here](https://cdn.mikrocloud.com/downloads/winbox-handler.reg)

:::Note
Running this protocol handler will need **Elevated Privileges/ Administrator Privileges**, so make sure that you are able to run it.
:::

#### Step 5: Click and Launch
You are not set up to just click the WinBox icon on a Transient Access session, which will open WinBox on you machine locally and log you into the router automatically.




### macOS Launcher
This is a quick walkthrough and installation guide for the WinBox launcher for macOS users.

#### Prerequisites
* You should have **Wine** installed and configured on you machine before continuing with the installation of the WinBox Launcher for macOS.

:::warning
Installation instructions for **Wine** can be found [here](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download).
:::

#### Step 1: Download the WinBox Launcher for macOS
1. You can contact support to provide you with the **mikrocloud-winbox-launcher.app** file.

#### Step 2: Download WinBox
1. Download the latest version of **WinBox** from the MikroTik Website.

:::Note
You can also click on [this](https://mt.lv/winbox64) link that will download it directly from the MikroTik website.
:::

#### Step 3: Move the files into your Applications folder
1. Move the files that you just downloaded into your main `Applications` folder on your macOS machine.

2. Make sure that these files are in the following directories:
    * **/Applications/MikroCloud macOS Launcher.app**
    * **winbox64.exe**

#### Step 4: Configure the launcher application
Depending on how and where you installed **Wine**, you might have to configure your application to work.

1. Open your terminal application and type the following:
   * `whereis wine`

It should display the folder location of where wine is installed.

## SSH Terminal
For users who prefer to use SSH, you can connect to your MikroTik directly from your portal.This process will automatically create the transient access and open a ssh terminal window on your site overview page.

#### Step 1: Navigate to your site
1. From your **Dashboard**, navigate to your `Sites`.

:::Warning
Please give the terminal a few moments to check connectivity between your machine and the terminal window.

A `Transient access` session will be opened and logs will also be added to the `Orchestration Log`
:::

3. Once the Configuration is finished, you will be presented with the `terminal window`, this is the MikroTik device's terminal, and you are free to check configurations and make changes as you would normally on a locally connected MikroTik's terminal.
