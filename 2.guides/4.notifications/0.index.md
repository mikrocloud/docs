Notifications in MikroCloud play a crucial role in keeping you informed about important network events. They also help ensure that you are promptly alerted with relating to SLA Breaches, connection failures or security concerns.

## Why are Notifications Important?
#### Proactive Issue Management:
By receiving timely notifications, you can address potential issues before they escalate into bigger problems.

#### Improved Network Uptime:
Notifications allow for faster response times, which helps in minimizing downtime.

#### Enhanced Security:
Alerts related to security events ensure immediate attention to potential threats.

#### Customizable Alerts:
Notifications can be tailored to specific users, ensuring that only relevant people are notified about specific events.

For example, your **NOC** might not need to see Security alerts, and your **SOC** might not need to see network site connection failures.

## Notification Types
MikroCloud offers a couple of notification event types which will be listed below.

| Notification Type | Descriptio |
