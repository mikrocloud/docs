:::warning
Enabling DoH/DoT blocking will restrict all DNS traffic to external servers (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare) and redirect queries to the mikroCloud DNS filter resolver.

For proper functionality of DNS filtering, it is recommended to enable DoH/Dot as many devices and applications such as smart phones and browsers have built in DoH functionality that would circumvent the DNS redirecting.
Internal DNS, like AD servers on a local subnet will not be affected, however, any external DNS queries from the AD server will also be redirected to the MikroCloud resolver.
