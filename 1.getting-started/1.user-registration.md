## Registering as a new user

New users can register for an account by visiting the MikroCloud registration page,
which can be accessed at the following URL:

[https://oauth.mikrocloud.com/authenticate/register](https://oauth.mikrocloud.com/authenticate/register)

For more information on the password policy, see the [Password Policy](/documentation/resources/password-policy) documentation.

Once registration is complete and the user has verified their email address, please proceed to the ew documentation.

## Supported Identity Providers

MikroCloud implements industry-standard OAuth 2.0 authentication,
aside from traditional email and password registration; users can choose to register using one of the following identity providers:

:::idp-grid
:::social-login{name="Google"}

When authenticating using a social login provider, the following read-only scopes are requested:

| IDP       | Scopes                 | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google    | `openid,profile,email` | Email, email verified flag, name, public profile URL, profile picture, country, language and timezone |
| GitHub    | `openid,user,email`    | Firstname, lastname, profile picture, email                                                           |
| Microsoft | `openid,profile,email` | Name, email, profile picture                                                                          |

## Email Verification

Regardless of the identity provider used, all new users must verify their email address.
The authentication system will not allow unverified users to perform onboarding or access the MikroCloud portal.

During the registration process, the user will receive an email with a link to verify their email address.

| Email Address             | Subject Line         | Sender                   |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `no-reply@mikrocloud.com` | Verify Email Address | `mailman.mikrocloud.com` |

The link in the email will be a [MikroCloud Short URL](/documentation/resources/short-links) that redirects to the
MikroCloud portal.

All emails from MikroCloud are signed with a valid DKIM signature.

## Inferences

During registration, the following information is derived from the user's IP address:

* Country
* Timezone

This can be changed later in the User Profile page.
