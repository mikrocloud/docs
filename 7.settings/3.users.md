## Understanding the Concept of a User

A **user** can be categorized into two main types:

* Notification Users
* Portal Users

### Notification Users

Notification users are individuals within your organization who need to receive automated communications,
such as network outage notifications or SLA reports, but do not require access to log into the MikroCloud portal.
They are essential for ensuring that critical information is promptly and efficiently disseminated to relevant stakeholders
without providing portal access.

To create a notification user, make sure to <u>turn off</u> the **Allow Login** option when adding a new user.

### Portal Users

Portal users are those who can log into the MikroCloud portal.
These users can interact with the system directly to perform administrative tasks,
access detailed system data, and configure settings.
It is important to note that notification users do not have login capabilities
and cannot perform account recovery actions.
This distinction ensures that access and notifications are tailored to the specific needs and roles within the organization.
