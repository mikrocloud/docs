title: Roles & Permissions
---

User **Roles & Permissions** determinw what actions users can perform and what features they can access within your MikroCloud portal. Managing roles ensures that each user has the correct level of access based on their responsibilities within the team.

---
## Roles Overview

Each user in MikroCloud is assigned a role, and that role dictates the specific permissions they hold. **Permissions** define the level of control users have over the portal's different components, such as viewing, creating, updating or deleting resources.

In the `Roles & Permissions` section of the portal, administrators can manage the roles for the current team.

| Role             | Overview                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Roles** | These are predefined roles that come with default permissions.                    |
| **Custom Roles** | These are roles that are created to fit the specific needs for your organization. |


### Permissions and their Impact on Portal Visibility
The specific permisions assigned to a role determine the features that are visible and accessible to users. For example, a role with the **Teams View** permission can only view the teams but cannot create, delete or update them.
