## Introduction
In MikroCloud, a **Team** is a structured group of users who collaborate to manage and operate specific devices/ sites and resources. Teams serve as the foundation for organizing and controlling access to these resources from your organization's MikroCloud Portal.


#### Teams are essential for several reasons.
**1. Resource Ownership:**

All resources (sites, policies, scripts, logs, etc.) are owned by a team. This means that access to these resources is controlled at the team level. Only users who are members of the team can interact with these resources, based on their assigned roles.

**2. Collaboration:**

Teams facilitate collaboration by grouping users who need to work together on the same set of resources. For instance, a NoC team might manage all the devices in a particular region, while a security team will focus on policy management and vulnerabilities.

**3. Flexibility:**

Users can belong to multiple teams, enabling them to contribute to different projects or areas within your organization. This flexibility is crucial for large orgs where responsibilities mgiht overlap or where cross-functional collaboration is needed.
